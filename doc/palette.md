# Palette

Provides color and theming functionality.

The `EufemiaPaletteData` class is a collection of colors that are used throughout the library of components. You can create your own, or use several presets, like the `saga`, `standard`, `dark` and `privateBanking` factories.

The palette provider can be accessed using

```dart
final palette = EufemiaPalette.of(context)
```
