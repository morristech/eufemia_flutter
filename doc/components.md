# Components

The Eufemia components are a set of widgets that are built from scratch and as specified by the Eufemia design system. All components are ready to use as children of the `Eufemia` widget, and require no additional setup.

For usage examples, check the [example app](https://github.com/dnb-asa/eufemia_flutter/tree/master/example)
